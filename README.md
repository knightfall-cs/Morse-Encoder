**Morse Encoder** is a Python script designed for encoding text into Morse code, complete with audio playback. You can customize timings, frequency, and Morse code audio playback settings.


## What is Morse Code?

Morse code is a method of encoding text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called "dots" and "dashes" or "short signals" and "long signals." It was widely used for long-distance communication before the advent of modern telecommunications systems. Each letter, numeral, or symbol is represented by a unique combination of these signals, making it a versatile and efficient means of transmitting information through visual or auditory signals.

Morse code has historical significance and is still relevant in various fields, including amateur radio, aviation, and emergency communication. This script allows you to encode text into Morse code and experience it through audio playback, providing an engaging way to explore this timeless communication method.


## Features

- Encode text into Morse code.
- Play Morse code audio.
- Adjust dot and dash timings.
- Create custom WAV files with different frequency.


## Installation

1. **Python:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Clone Repository:** Clone the `morse-encoder` repository to your local machine and navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/knightfall-cs/morse-encoder.git
    cd morse-encoder
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   ```


## Usage

1. Run the `morse_encoder.py` script to encode text into Morse code and play encoded audio.

2. Edit & Run the `generate_wave_file.py` script to generate custom wave files if needed.


## Sample Morse Code

**Input: "HELLO WORLD"**

**Output: ".... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -.."**
